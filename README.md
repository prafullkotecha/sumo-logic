# Sumo Logic

_Watch this space for updates inspiration from the Sumo Logic team!_

Spinnaker and Sumo Logic have an existing integration, the Spinnaker App for Sumo Logic, documented by [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/application/spinnaker/) and [Armory](https://docs.armory.io/docs/armory-admin/integrations-sumologic/). It provides insights into the deployments of a Spinnaker-managed SDLC.

We see great opportunity in extending the integration! Here are some ideas:

- Identify additional data from Spinnaker needed in Sumo Logic, such as more detailed pipeline and stage information, to provide useful visualization, benchmarking, or monitoring.
- Build visualization of additional pipeline data in the Spinnaker App for Sumo Logic.
- Expand the Spinnaker App  for Sumo Logic to help teams benchmark and optimize software delivery performance against key DORA metrics like lead time and deployment frequency.
- Update Sumo Logic's [Terraform provider](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-provider-sumologic) to include Spinnaker support.
- Build a Spinnaker plugin that bring Sumo Logic's analysis of software delivery performance to Spinnaker dashboards or policy decision-making capability.
